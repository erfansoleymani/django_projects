# django_projects
This GitHub repository contains my coursework for the **Django for Everybody Specialization**. It includes projects on building and deploying Django applications, designing data models, using Django's built-in authentication, and integrating JavaScript and jQuery. The final project is a classified ads website with search and favorite features.
