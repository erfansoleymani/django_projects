## Specialization Overview  
The specialization consists of four courses, covering **HTML, CSS, SQL, Django, JavaScript, jQuery, and JSON Web Services**. Each course includes **hands-on projects** where students develop working Django web applications that are evaluated throughout the course. This training prepares learners to transition into more advanced web development using **Flask, Ruby on Rails, or PHP**.  

### Prerequisites

- **User authentication system** (login/logout functionality)  
- **Database models for classified ads** (including images, categories, and favorites)  
- **Search functionality** to filter ads  
- **Frontend styling** using HTML & CSS  
- **Deployment-ready code** for hosting the project online  

This project serves as **a portfolio piece** for showcasing web development skills.
